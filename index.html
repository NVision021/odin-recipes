      <h1>Odin Recipes: IDDSI Recipe Book</h1>

      <p>This is a recipe book I created as part of The Odin Project. 
      As a speech pathology student, I have created a cookbook for people with dysphagia, a condition impacting swallowing, 
      including a recipe from each of the IDDSI diet textures.</p>
